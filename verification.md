# Verification

Running psst-demo on a single pico (ie, same base clock to all SMs).


## Overview

![](diagrams/2-pulse-to-high.png)

Generally checking that everything is working.
The demo code toggles pulse and sends a word each millisecond,
note the repeating DOUT pattern changes from 01100 to 01010.

* PULSE = input to TX
* CLOCK = output from WDOG
* DOUT = data-out from TX
* /ERR = /error output from WDOG
* R.CLK = clock output from RX
* R.PLS = /pulse output from RX

Note the noise on RX pulse output - needs an external pullup.


## Clock

![](diagrams/4-320ns-3_125MHz.png)

System clock is 125 MHz (8 ns), 40 periods per frame measured at
3.125 MHz (320 ns).


## Serial Data Word

![](diagrams/7-30-bit-word.png)

DOUT showing 30 bits - 320 ns / bit x 30 bits = 9.600 us.


## Clock Delay

![](diagrams/5-clock-propagation.png)

Measuring clock delay from TX to RX = 217 ns.

After fixing input buffering, 1 clock cycle faster (210 ns).


## Pulse Propagation

![](diagrams/6-pulse-propagation.png)

Measuring pulse propagation from TX input to RX output = 223 ns.

After fixing input buffering, no change - not unexpected as the
pulse sampling is fixed within the frame, and the demo is not designed
to stress this delay.


## Watchdog Frequency

![](diagrams/8-watchdog-1kHz.png)

Measuring period between petting watchdog (rate limited by the WDOG
reading from its TxFIFO) = 1.000 ms.


## Watchdog Expired

![](diagrams/9-watchdog-expired.png)

Comment out the pet watchdog in the main loop, observe that everything
stops with /error asserted and clock low.

Note RX clock remains high as it does not toggle until a rising edge
on data-in is seen.

Note noise on /error - it needs an external pullup.


## Open Drain Drives Low

![](diagrams/3-pulse-to-low.png)

When driving RX output pulse low, it stays at 0 without noise.
Not ideal, but difficult to correct.
